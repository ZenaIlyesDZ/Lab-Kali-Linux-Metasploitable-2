# Installation
For this project, we need 2 Virtual Machine : Metasploitable 2 and Kali Linux
For me, I use VirtualBox but you can use any other virtualization software 
### Metasploitable 2
Metasploitable 2 is a vulnerable machine based on Ubuntu, it was created by Rapid7 to learn basics of pentesting
### Kali Linux
Kali Linux is a Linux distribution specialy made for pentesting, it is the most used OS in pentesting

---

To learn with this Lab, you need to know the basics of Linux, networking and cybersecurity in general.

## How to install our 2 machine ?
### For Metasploitable 2
The first step is to obtain the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine image. This is freely available for download. We need to navigate to the website (some links below) and download the Metasploitable 2 file. This file will be in a compressed format, so after downloading the file, we need to unzip it. This will provide a .vmdk file, which is the virtual hard disk for the VM.​

### For Kali Linux
We need to go to the official website of Kali Linux, and select the correct platform, for my, I will go for VirtualBox prebuilt image.
